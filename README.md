# Termpage

This is a terminal style startpage which I made it was insipired by a reddit post by a now deleted account on the /r/startpage subreddit.

# How the startpage works

The startpage just basically works as a normal terminal **(kinda)** and you can hit Tab to autocomplete and even type urls

# Configuration(TODO)

Need to TODO configuration

I may continue to work on and update this **(maybe)**
